# lncDIFF
lncDIFF is an R package for low-counts long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) differential expression analysis, using generalized linear model with zero-inflated exponential quasi likelihood. It can be applied to commonly used normalized counts, e.g. RPKM (FPKM), TMM, UQ. The package is avaialbe on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lncDIFF/index.html
